# Upgrading 0.2.1 version

## Prerequisites

* A networked Admin tails workstation configured with the SecureDrop repo cloned to the `Persistent` directory.

* Physical/remote access to the app and monitor servers

## Upgrade 0.2.1 steps

* Checkout and verify the current release on the Admin Workstation.
  ```sh
  cd /home/amnesia/Persistent/SecureDrop
  git pull
  git checkout 0.3.3
  git tag -v 0.3.3
  ```

* Copy the 0.2.1 migration script to the app server using scp or physical media (usb).

  `/home/amnesia/Persistent/securedrop/migration_scripts/0.2.1/0.2.1_collect.py`

* On the app server, run `0.2.1_collect.py` as root and provide a name for the backup.

  `sudo ./0.2.1_collect.py sdbackup`

* Copy `sdbackup.tar.gz` to removable media and transfer it to the  new instance's app server. If you are re-using the same hardware for  your 0.3 installation as you did for 0.2.1, make sure you copy this file to a external media before beginning the 0.3 installation - otherwise you will lose your data!

* Perform a fresh [install](https://github.com/freedomofpress/securedrop/blob/develop/docs/install.md) of the app and monitor servers.

* Make sure you've created at least one user on the Document Interface (with `./manage.py add_admin`) before continuing.

* Once you've successfully installed 0.3, copy `sdbackup.tar.gz` to any location on the 0.3 app server. You will need `0.3_migrate.py`, along with the rest of the files in `migration_scripts/0.2.1`. You can copy the `0.2.1` directory to the running instance with a flash drive, or `git clone` the repo on the new app server and `cd` into `securedrop/migration_scripts/0.2.1`.

* Once that's done, run `0.3_migrate.py` as root, passing the path to the backup from the 0.2.1 machine.

  `sudo ./0.3_migrate.py sdbackup.tar.gz`

The script will say "Done!" when it completes successfully.  Otherwise, it will print an error and a Python traceback. If you  encounter such an error, please encrypt the traceback and email it to us at securedrop@freedom.press.

Finally, test your new installation and make sure that everything was successfully migrated.
