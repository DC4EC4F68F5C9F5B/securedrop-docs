# Setting up an encrypted external drive

Tails is an operating system that boots off of removable media, either a DVD or a USB stick. For SecureDrop you'll need to install Tails onto USB sticks so that you can enable persistent storage, set up an encrypted external drive for backup purposes, and so on

The [Tails website](https://tails.boum.org/) has detailed and up-to-date instructions on how to [create and use encrypted volumes](https://tails.boum.org/doc/encryption_and_privacy/encrypted_volumes/index.en.html). If you have not already installed Tails onto a USB stick or SD card, read the guide on [installing Tails on USB sticks](https://github.com/freedomofpress/securedrop/blob/develop/docs/tails_config.md) first.
