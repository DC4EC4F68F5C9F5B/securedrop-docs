Welcome to SecureDrop's documentation!
======================================

SecureDrop is an open-source whistleblower submission system that media
organizations can use to securely accept documents from and communicate with
anonymous sources.

This is the end-user documentation, for sources and journalists who use
SecureDrop, and administrators who are interested in setting up and maintaining
a SecureDrop. The developer documentation is maintained separately, on the
`Github project wiki`_.
