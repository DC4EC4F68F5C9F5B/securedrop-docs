Set up Admin Tails USB and Workstation
======================================

Earlier, you should have created the *admin Tails USB* along with a
persistence volume for it. Now, we are going to add a couple more
features to the *admin Tails USB* to facilitate SecureDrop's setup.

If you have not switched to and booted the *admin Tails USB* on your
regular workstation, do so now.

Start Tails and enable the persistent volume
--------------------------------------------

After you boot the *admin Tails USB* on your normal workstation, you
should see a *Welcome to Tails* screen with two options. Select *Yes* to
enable the persistent volume and enter your password, but do NOT click
Login yet. Under 'More Options," select *Yes* and click *Forward*.

Enter an *Administration password* for use with this specific Tails
session and click *Login*. (NOTE: the *Administration password* is a
one-time password. It will reset every time you shut down Tails.)

After Tails is fully booted, make sure you're connected to the Internet
|Network| and that the Tor's Vidalia indicator onion |Vidalia| is green,
using the icons in the upper right corner.
