# Installing Tails on USB sticks

Tails is an operating system that boots off of removable media, either a DVD or a USB stick. For SecureDrop you'll need to install Tails onto USB sticks so that you can enable persistent storage.

The [Tails website](https://tails.boum.org/) has detailed and up-to-date instructions on how to download and verify Tails, and how to create a Tails USB stick. Here are some links to help you out:

You need to create two Tails USB sticks. Once you have them, use the `Secure Viewing Station` to configure persistent storage on each of them. Make sure your persistent volume includes "Personal Data" on the internet-connected one, and both "Personal Data" and "GnuPG" on the air-gapped one.
